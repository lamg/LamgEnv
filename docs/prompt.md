original prompt:
```
logo for F# library containing utility functions.
```

revised prompt
```
Create a logo for a software library. The logo should visually represent the concept of utility functions, perhaps with overlapping geometric shapes like squares and circles to symbolize the diverse functions in the library. It should incorporate the symbol F# prominently within the design, weaving it into the overall aesthetic. The color scheme should reflect a balanced mix of professional and innovative tones, perhaps using blues or purples for the geometric shapes and a contrasting color for the F# symbol. The logo should be sleek, modern, and encapsulate the technological essence of a programming library.
